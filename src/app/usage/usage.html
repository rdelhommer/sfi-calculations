  <h2>Microscope Data Spreadsheet Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Fill out <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Organization</strong>, <strong>Address</strong>, <strong>Email</strong>, <strong>Phone</strong>, and <strong>Sample Name</strong> for the sample you are completing. (Only what is applicable for each sample.)
    </li>
    <li>
      For the <strong>Sample Name</strong>, select from the drop down menu the type of sample that is being tested. 
    </li>
    <li>
      In the <strong>Plant Present/Desired</strong> line, fill out the species of either what plants are currently growing in the location or what type of plants are desired to be grown.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the <strong>Plant Succession</strong>, select from the drop down menu the succession that the present/desired plant species is most likely to fit in to. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill out the <strong>Date Collected</strong>, <strong>Date Observed</strong>, <strong>Observed By</strong>, and <strong>Notes</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter in the <strong>Main Dilution</strong> that was used for observing the <strong>Nematodes</strong>, <strong>Actinobacteria</strong>, <strong>Fungi</strong>, <strong>Oomycetes</strong>, and <strong>Protozoa</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter in the <strong>Bacteria Dilution</strong> that was used for observing the <strong>Bacteria</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm if 1 or 2 drops were used in the sample observed in the <strong>Drops per sample</strong> line. Use the drop down menu.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm the size of coverslip that was used for observing the sample in the <strong>Coverslip Size</strong> line. Use the drop down menu for selecting the coverslip size.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter in the <strong>Views Per Reading</strong> the number of views that were observed in each field except for the bacterial count.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nematodes</strong>: You must scan the whole area of the coverslip to count the number of nematodes in the sample. Scanning for nematodes at either a total magnification of 40X or 100X is recommended. For each nematode seen, you must identify; which if needed, you can go up in magnification. Input in the amount of each type of nematode observed in the appropriate cell.
      <br/>
      <strong>**All of the following microorganism quantifications must be done at 400X Total Magnification**</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Actinobacteria</strong>: Measure the length of actinobacteria observed in each field while going through the sample.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fungi</strong>: In each reading, you must measure the length and diameter for each fungal hypha that is observed. When multiple fungal hyphae are seen in a field, there is an option to click the <strong>Calculation Button</strong> directly below each Reading to take you to the <strong>Fungal Calculation</strong> form. In the <strong>Fungal Calculation</strong> form, enter all the fungal hyphal measurements that were observed in the current field that you are in. Press the <strong>Transfer</strong> button that is next to the results for the current field; which will transfer the results and return you back to the <strong>Microscope Data Spreadsheet</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Oomycetes</strong>: In each reading, you must measure the length and diameter for each oomycetes hypha that is observed. When multiple oomycete hypha are seen in a field, there is an option to click the <strong>Calculation Button</strong> directly below each field to take you to the <strong>Fungal Calculation</strong> form. In the <strong>Fungal Calculation</strong> form, enter all the fungal hypha measurements that were observed in the current field that you are in. Press the <strong>Transfer</strong> button that is next to the results for the current field; which will transfer the results and return you back to the <strong>Microscope Data Spreadsheet</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Flagellate</strong>: Enter in the total number of flagellates observed in each field.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Amoebae</strong>: Enter in the total number of amoeba observed in each field.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ciliates</strong>: Enter in the total number of ciliates observed in each field.
      <br/>
      <strong>**When counting the Bacteria, count the bacterium in 1 view of each of the 5 fields.**</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the drop down menu, choose the option of <strong>How much of the field did you count?</strong> that you used to do your bacterial counts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter in each of the <strong>Bacteria</strong> field the actual count that was observed. In the <strong>Results</strong> cells to the left, the total bacteria for each field will be calculated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the drop down menu, choose the best answer for your observation of <strong>Aerobic Bacteria being present in the sample or not</strong>. If <strong>Yes</strong>, use the drop down menu's to the right to document the shapes of bacteria observed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the drop down menu, choose the best answer for your observation of <strong>Anaerobic Bacteria being present in the sample or not</strong>. If <strong>Yes</strong>, use the drop down menu's to the right to document the shapes of bacteria observed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the drop down menu, choose the best answer for your observation of <strong>Pathogenic Bacteria being present in the sample or not</strong>. If <strong>Yes</strong>, use the drop down menu's to the right to document the shapes of bacteria observed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the <strong>Return to Top</strong> button to return to the top of the <strong>Microscope Data Spreadsheet</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>When</strong> done entering in the data from the microorganism observation of the sample and are ready to save, please remember to always save this document as <strong>"Save As"</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the buttons that are at the top of the <strong>Microscope Data Spreadsheet</strong> and to the right of the sample information, you can choose to either go to the <strong>Results Fill Sheet</strong>, <strong>Report</strong>, or <strong>Print Sheet</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you would like to write a <strong>Report</strong>, click the button to go to the <strong>Results Fill Spreadsheet</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once at the <strong>Results Fill Sheet</strong>, follow the instructions at the top of the sheet on how to fill out the sheet using the <strong>Dropdown Options</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      After choosing all of the best options for the sample on the <strong>Results Fill Sheet</strong>, click the <strong>Return to Top</strong> button. Then click the <strong>Go to Report</strong> button for the final overview of the report.
